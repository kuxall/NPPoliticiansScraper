Thapa was selected as a member of advisory council in 1958 and was elected as the chairperson. Later he was appointed to the Upper house in 1959 and was appointed to the chair of the Council of Ministers from 1963 to 1964.  He went on to serve four further terms: 1965–69 1979–83 1997–98 and again in 2003 before leaving his  in November 2004.
Surya Bahadur Thapa was the first Prime Minister under the  System of Nepal. In his later years he was the leader of . He died on 15 April 2015 from respiratory failure while undergoing surgery.
Surya Bahadur Thapa was born on March 21 1928 in the village of Muga in  district.  He began his political career in the underground student movement in 1950. In November 1958 he was selected to the national assembly as an independent and became Chairman of the Advisory Council. In 1959 Thapa was elected to the Upper House. He was appointed Minister of Agriculture Forest and Industry under the newly formed  system. Subsequently he served as Member of National Legislature and .
Despite not even standing for election in 1963 Thapa was nominated to the National Panchyat by  and was appointed chair of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Finance Law Justice and General Administration. During this period he was instrumental in abolishing ""Land-Birta-System"" and set strategies to promote land reform by consolidating tenancy rights of the tenants. Thapa was responsible for ""Muluki-Ain"" through which he attempted to eradicate the practice of an  and promote women's suffrage among other social activism.
In 1966 Thapa was again appointed Prime Minister under the modified Constitution of Nepal. He was responsible for expanding the coverage of the constitution of 1962 and promulgated its second amendment to make it ""people oriented"".  In 1967 Thapa tendered his resignation saying that the long tenure of one prime minister was undemocratic in the development of the country.
In October 1972 Thapa was arrested and imprisoned in Nakhhu Jail when he demanded political reform in his Itum-Bahal public address. The speech promoted a 13-point resolution which included democratic changes in the Constitution and restoring rights to the people with democratic elections. He went on a 21-day hunger strike in March 1974 demanding major political reform in the country.
After pro-democracy demonstrations in 1979 Nepali voters chose to uphold the Panchayat system in a referendum in 1980 and King Birendra appointed Thapa Prime Minister on June 1 1980. The referendum was accompanied by a general amnesty for political prisoners.
Thapa maintained the position through a parliamentary election in 1981.  After serving a further two years he resigned in 1983 when his government lost a no confidence vote.
Between 1983 and 1990 Thapa often spoke on politics criticizing those who were against democratic reform and urging the strengthening of political and economic development processes in the country. Thapa's statements were quoted in many leading national newspapers. There was an attempt to assassinate one of the editors (Padam Thakurathi) who published Thapa's views.  An attempt was made to assassinate Thapa himself while he was traveling through Jhallari West Nepal.
In 1990 the  led to the institution of a  system of government with multiple political parties. Thapa started the  (RPP) and was elected chairman of the party four years later. The party did not win the 1991 or 1994 elections but after two successive governments suffered no-confidence motions within a year King Birendra asked Thapa to form a new coalition government on October 7 1997. The next February Thapa's government survived a no-confidence vote ending the year-long constitutional crisis.  Thapa then conceded the prime ministership to his coalition partner  of the Nepali Congress.
In 2002 Thapa presided over the Third National Convention of RPP in Pokhara which paved the way for new leadership within the RPP Party.  In June 2003 he was appointed Prime Minister of Nepal for the sixth time. During this tenure as prime Minister he also held the Defense Minister position.   Under Thapa the government offered women special reservations and quotas in government for the first time via the Public Service Commission. Special quotas were also provided to the under-privileged Dalits and Janajatis for higher education.
Under Thapa's tenure the government offered the Maoists a 75-point socio-economic and political reform package during peace talks.  However the peace talks failed. To counter the persistent bloody attacks on the police army and civilians Thapa set up the Unified Command.  Under the program the police army and armed security functioned as a cohesive team to combat terrorism in the country. Thapa secured arms military hardware and aircraft for the army from donor countries (India USA and Great Britain) as military aid. When the country was reeling under civil war he remained adamant that no commissions should be made on arms unlike his predecessors. All arms procured during this period were under grant aid.
In November 2003 Thapa as the Chairman of the SAARC urged the Indian Prime Minister  and Pakistani President  to participate in the SAARC Summit in Islamabad. His active participation and persuasion as the SAARC Chairman brought both these nuclear countries to table at the summit.  Thapa also became the first Nepali Prime Minister to make an official visit to the Druk Kingdom of . Several bilateral agreements were initiated with the SAARC countries during this historic visit.
On May 7 2004 Thapa resigned after to a street protest staged by the five party alliance. In his resignation speech to the nation he insisted that he would continue to play an active role to forge national consensus. Thapa lead a caretaker government for 25 days as the parties failed to nominate a consensual individual to the post of the prime minister. He officially stepped down on June 2.
In August 2004 Thapa made his first public statement after his resignation asking the party leadership to call for a Special General Convention. The Special General Convention was never called however. Thapa then proposed the Broader National Political Conference amongst all democratic political parties in order to create an alternative democratic force in the country against the new Maoist government.
 emerged from a split in the  as Thapa left RPP on November 4 2004. On November 19 2004 Thapa and his followers opened a contact office in Balutwar  to organise a ""broad political conference"" and coordinate the construction of a new party. The RJP was founded on March 13 2005. The political conference was however postponed due to the imposition of emergency rule by  on February 1 2005.
RJP had expressed differences with King Gyanendra after the February 1 2005 coup on political appointments in the local administrations. RJP accused the King of eliminating the forces working for constitutional monarchy through his political actions. At the time RJP tried to profile itself as a centrist party in between positions advocating direct monarchical rule and republic.  During the Loktantra Andolan the RJP suggested that the King Gyanendra would initiate talks with constitutional forces. When the King was stripped of his political powers by the interim parliament RJP did not object and in November 2006 the Prajatantrik Nepal Party led by Keshar Bahadur Bista merged into RJP.
Ahead of the Constituent Assembly election RJP proposed having a mixed election system with 75 district representatives and 230 members elected through proportional representation. The party also proposed creating an ""Ethnic Assembly"" as the upper house of parliament.
On February 6 2008 Thapa initiated unity talks with the leader of RPP Pashupati Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. In a joint press conference both Thapa and Rana agreed to unite RJP-RPP as one single party.  On March 6 he declared that his party was not monarchist but would accept the verdict of the voters. RJP MPs had previously boycotted a vote in the interim parliament on making Nepal a republic. Thapa had dubbed the vote ""an attack on the fundamental norms of democracy"".

Kunwar Inderjit Singh,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunwar_Inderjit_Singh,"Kunwar Inderjit Singh (: ; 1906 – 4 October 1982) popularly known as  or just  was a Nepali politician and revolutionary who served as the 20th  in 1957. He was key  in organizing  the  and was a leader in its militant wing the  who later refused to recognize the  and was forced to flee the country following a revolt he took part in. In 1955 he returned and formed the  and following the installation of the  he agitated for its end for which he was jailed. Following his release he went into self-imposed exile and much later returned to Nepal and was elected a member to the . He was known as the ""Robin Hood of the Himalayas"" and was very popular throughout the country.
K.I. Singh was born in the  of Nepal and his father was a minor  landlord. He was educated in India and also served in the Indian Army where he received medical training. Eventually he set up a medical practice in  an Indian town on the India-Nepal border.
Before the revolution he met with Bholanath Sharma a  organizer and other Congress members which led to him joining the Congress in their struggle against the . He operated out of Nautanwa and became a manager of the Congress party office there. He was an effective organizer and was able to get support from people he knew through his medical practice and ex-servicemen from India.
When the fighting began he crossed the border into Nepal with a group of around a dozen men and around 8-9 rifles. He set himself up in the village of Myudihawa but was faced with much pressure from government forces which forced him and his men to move to Karabla another village that was more defensible for it was surrounded on three sides by a river. Though he lacked both weapons and food at first he was able to get both from the countryside defeating government forces his old Indian ex-serviceman friends and a wealthy  called Radhakumari(popularly called 'Muwa by her well wishers') one of the few zamindar's who took the side of the rebels. He was not however properly supported by Gopal Shumsher the son of  a Rana who was in the line of succession but was removed following 's purge in 1934. Gopal was a C-class Rana who was in command of Singh's section of the border but Singh had a history of being hostile to all Rana's even boycotting a merger with the Nepali National Congress and 's Nepali Democratic Congress and therefore did not work effectively with Gopel and did not receive proper support from him.
K.I. Singh's main focus throughout the revolution was the city of Bhairawa (current day ) which he tried to take from the forces of the Bada Hakim (leader) of Bhairawa though he was unsuccessful. Singh's most serious clashes were with the local  who were extremely unpopular among the peasantry for allegedly bringing in Indian  to loot their villages in 1949–50. When the fighting began these zamindars sent their families to India and started cooperating with the Bada Hakim of Bhairawa. Singh's battles with the zamindars was extremely brutal. For example after storming the house of zamindar Bhubaneshwar Shukla nine government soldiers who were inside were gunned down immediately for allegedly mistreating rebels previously and fifty Indian goondas who were there tried to escape but were killed by the villages who helped Singh with the siege. When he begged Singh for his life one of Singh's followers clubbed him to death with a  and the villagers later battered his corpse.
The  officially brought about the end of the revolution. It was a compromise between the   and  which allowed for the creation of a government of a mix between Rana's and Nepali Congress members with  remaining as . Though K.I. Singh was asked to stop the fighting he refused to accept the Delhi Accord and was dissatisfied with the leadership of Nepali Congress. He launched another unsuccessful attack on Bhairawa but was soon arrested in February 1951 by Indian and Nepali troops. When he was captured his force was said to number 200-400 men. Following his arrest he quickly escaped but was recaptured and sent to a jail in .
The Raksha Dal was an auxiliary security force set up immediately after the revolution mostly from members of the  Nepali Congress' militant wing. In January 1952  a militant revolutionary similar to K.I. Singh who also refused to accept the Delhi Accord started a protest in  against Prime Minister  and the Delhi Accord. After Rai had made a speech in the city declaring the need for a renewed revolt he was arrested. This arrest led to a revolt of the Raksha Dal in Kathmandu who freed both Ram Prasad Rai and K.I. Singh from jail and occupied the . Rai and Singh tried to negotiate with the government but after a few days the revolting Raksha Dal were defeated for the army and most of the Raksha Dal officers remained loyal to the government. Both Rai and Singh fled Nepal into Tibet to the north but Rai died en route.
Following his escape to Tibet K.I. Singh was allowed in by the Communist Chinese government and stayed in  during his exile. During his exile he lived a secluded life and was not heard from for around two years. He also did not receive any support from the Chinese government and apparently did not meet either  or . While he was away he became a legend in Nepal and the ""Society of Friends of K.I. Singh"" was formed to agitate for his return.
In 1955 he was sent back to Kathmandu from Beijing for allegedly threatening suicide if he wasn't allowed to return. He re-entered Nepal in August 1955 and was pardoned by . A massive parade was held in Kathmandu to celebrate his return.
In October 1955 K.I. Singh formed the  (UDP) or United Democratic Front as an alternative to the  a party that had dominated Nepal since the . He claimed that the political parties of Nepal had been unsuccessful and were full of infighting while the people suffered. However it was mostly just a party based solely around Singh rather than a party with any proper platform or ideology. It is also alleged that Singh formed the UDP with funding from  to try to counter the influence of Nepali Congress.
Singh did not espouse any particular ideology though he was generally left-wing. Many claimed that he was a communist but he denied it even though many of his views on issues coincided with those of the Communist Party and the communists allegedly assisted in the Raksha Dal Revolt. He was said to be both a royalist and a revolutionary and he espoused nationalist isolationist and anti-imperialist rhetoric. He claimed to not work for any party or have any ideology; rather he was solely working for the betterment of Nepal. His view on India was contradictory both claiming India was an imperialist power who controlled Nepal and talking of the need of Nepali-Indian cooperation.
In July 1957 K.I. Singh was made Prime Minister by Mahendra replacing his predecessor  of the . However his 110-day premiership was unremarkable and mostly wasted with conspiracies and attempts to curtail Singh's enemies. He resigned as Prime Minister on 15 November however the reason for this is unclear. There were claims that there were conspiracies against Singh involving foreign powers like the  though it is not known for sure. There were also rumors that he resigned due to a disagreement with the King.
In 1959 there were the first democratic elections in Nepali history where Nepali Congress won a massive victory taking 74 of the 109 seats available. Many notable party leaders like K.I. Singh and Tanka Prasad Acharya did not win their seats but their parties still gained some. With Nepali Congress forming a government the second largest party the right-wing Gorkha Parishad who were supported and made up by the  became the opposition. However Singh wanted to lead the official opposition party and therefore formed a United Front with Acharya's wing of the Praja Parishad the . This United Front was according to Singh formed to guard Nepal's highest values like nationalism democracy good government and social justice. Later on in 1959 Singh convinced the two members of parliament for Acharya's party to instead join his party leaving Acharya with no political representation.
In 1960  removed the Nepali Congress government and installed the  a party-less semi-dictatorial system. At first K.I. Singh supported the move however his opinion began to shift wildly soon after it began changing from ardent support for the king to criticism of the system multiple times. In April 1963 he stated he planned to launch a  to agitate for the restoration of parliamentary democracy. Eventually after negotiating with the King to try to gain some form of political office in March 1964 he announced the satyagraha would go ahead leading to his arrest. Following an appeal to the  he was acquitted and released in June 1965 after which he went into self-imposed exile. Many years later he joined the  and was elected as a representative in the  in the . A year later K.I. Singh died of throat cancer aged 77."

During the process two other major parties the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and Madhesi Jana Adhikar Forum also withdrew their support from the coalition. On the third day 24 July 2016 after addressing the opposition parties in parliament Oli announced his resignation. The  was accused of conspiring in bringing down Oli as he stood firmly against the economic blockade imposed by India; an allegation categorically rejected by the  of India.

He passed a motion of confidence with on 11 March 2018 with 208 out of 268 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives. The left alliance of the CPN (UML) and CPN (Maoist Centre) merged to form the  on 17 May 2018 turning Oli's coalition government to a majority and giving him a two-third majority in the House.
In May 2020 the Oli government unveiled new maps of the country including the disputed territories of  Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in response to the inauguration of a road across the  by the Indian government which led to a ""cartographic war"" between the two countries.

In December 2020 the Oli government recommended the  and called for fresh elections on 30 April and 10 May 2021; a step that was readily endorsed by the president. Oli took this step after a series of infighting in the ruling NCP which culminated with a faction of the party led by former prime ministers  and  planning to register a motion of no-confidence against Oli in the House. Oli's reluctance in withdrawing a controversial Constitutional Council Act further led to tensions in the ruling party. This decision from Oli was overturned by the  on 23 February 2021 when a constitutional bench led by   deemed the dissolution of the House to be unconstitutional and called for the House to be reinstated and a meeting of the Parliament to be held within 13 days.

The court's verdict invalidated the ruling party jointly led by Oli and Dahal effectively reviving the former CPN (UML) and CPN (Maoist Centre) parties. This reduced Oli's government back to a coalition further mounting political tensions in the country. The CPN (Maoist Centre) recalled its ministers on 13 March 2021 and withdrew its support from the Oli government on 5 May 2021 effectively turning it into a minority government.

His status was subsequently converted to that of a caretaker prime minister until the appointment of another prime minister by the president.
Oli was appointed Prime Minister for a third time on 13 May 2021 by President Bidya Devi Bhandari albeit as a minority prime minister as none of the opposition parties were able to form a majority government or lay their claim for it in the provided time frame.

Mirza Dilshad Beg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Dilshad_Beg,"Mirza Dilshad Beg was a  parliamentarian with the dubious record of links with  . He was murdered in 1998 at around 9:30 pm in Siphal  in  at the time of Football World Cup.
Hailing from  near   Mirza began his forays into the underworld around late eighties. He grew in notoriety through car thefts assault kidnapping and of course murders; he later thought of his antecedents as petty crimes.
Mirza's graduation to the big league began after a chance meeting with  in Mumbai in the early eighties when both were struggling to carve a niche for themselves in India. Besides Dawood Mirza also had links with   the brothers  and members of the . However he shot to prominence only after his association with Pakistan's  operatives in India and Nepal.
The porous Indo-Nepal border helped him sneak in and out of his home state and into Nepal. From then on his notoriety grew so much that the UP police announced a reward for his arrest.
Beg the elusive crook found Kathmandu safer than UP. Dawood's reputation of transforming crooks into kings in India also helped him in Nepal. Playing the communal card in the election Mirza represented the Muslim minority in Hindu Nepal and won with a thumping majority. Beg had been elected to the House of Representatives from the  of  in 1994 and held ministerial portfolios in two governments.
He resigned from the  and joined the  winning two consecutive terms from the  constituency in south-west Nepal. Finally his shady past became his nemesis and began to erode his popularity as a politician.  officers believed that Mirza regularly used his Krishna Nagar mansion to shelter gangsters on the run from Indian enforcement agencies.
His residence was also used for other illegal activities including confinement of abductees drug-trafficking gun-running and forging of documents.
He was so effective that Dawood whose reach had spread from  to  and  to  regarded Kathmandu as his strongest base. In fact the mafia don even considered shifting to Kathmandu for a while following the  murder. The Indian government had tried to extradite his lieutenant  for the murder and had turned the heat on the  to secure Salem's custody. However it was Mirza's declining clout which forced him to change his mind making him opt for the ISI sanctuary in Karachi.
Mirza's greed turned him towards gun-running smuggling arms procured from the Afghan  and the ISI into India.
Mirza's exploits allegedly include an aborted bid on the life of UP Chief Minister  in . Mirza's murder had also stunned the Mumbai underworld as most fugitives had at some point in time used Mirza's good offices for passage out of the country.
Mirza Dilshad Beg was shot dead on June 29 1998 around 9:30 pm as he was on his way to visit his second wife in  Chabahil area. As he climbed from his car and was walking towards the residence killers gunned him down. His driver who was parking the car was also killed. In an interview published in the Indian newsmagazine  Rajendra Sadashiv Nikhalje alias  took the responsibility of killing Beg and alleged that ""through the ISI he (Beg) was spreading terror in India"".
The intelligence reports available with the Indian Authorities list three reasons why Beg was being targeted. Firstly while Beg had initially helped Babloo Srivastava obtain a Nepalese passport he did not come to his rescue when he was eventually arrested in Singapore in 1995. Babloo Srivastava's Nepalese citizenship was cancelled and he was handed over to the Indian authorities. 
Secondly following  killing in Mumbai the main hit-man  -- a close associate of  -- had absconded to  and his local hideout was raided by the Nepal police. Even as the modalities for Wahi's surrender were being worked out his dead body -- hacked into pieces -- was recovered at the Indo-Nepal border near Krishnanagar. Besides  Wahi's associates including Karan Singh Magga -- who was to eventually gun down Beg on 29 June 1998 along with underworld don 's associate Rohit Verma -- harbored a grudge against him.
The third angle to the Nepal MP's killing the intelligence report states related to Shafi Mohammad Khan of Krishnanagar who was arrested in a narcotics case by the Nepal Police in Mumbai. Like  he too was of the view that Mirza had made no efforts to secure his release after arrest nor was he extended sufficient help during his trial.
This along with the internecine  were the main reasons for Mirza's murder. Chhota Rajan is believed to have contacted Rohit Verma in Nepal to organise the killing and advised him not to strike in Kathmandu. Babloo Srivastava then contacted Shafi Mohammad and gave him some money to arrange for a safe house in Kathmandu. Despite taking the money Shafi was not able to find the place. The gang made its first attempt on Beg on 27 June 1998 and finally succeeded two days later when the MP was shot six or seven times before he finally collapsed ending a bloody chapter of the Mumbai mafia's free run in the Himalayan kingdom.
